Abstract

   RFC7575 defines Intent as an abstract high-level policy used to
   operate the network. Intent management system includes an interface
   for users to input requests and an engine to translate the intents
   into the network configuration and manage their life-cycle. Up to
   now, there is no commonly agreed definition, interface or model of
   intent.

   This document discusses the concept of intent. Specifically, it
   highlights stakeholder perspectives of intent, methods to classify
   and encode intent, the associated intent taxonomy, and defines
   relevant intent terms where necessary. This document provides a
   foundation for intent related research and facilitate solution
   development.

1. Introduction

   The vision of intent-driven networks has attracted a lot of
   attention, as it promises to simplify the management of networks by
   human operators by simply specifying what should happen on the
   network, without giving any instructions on how to do it. This

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification                July 2020


   promise led many telecom companies to begin adopting this new
   paradigm, and many SDOs to propose various intent variants.

   All SDOs, and open source projects, such as IETF [ANIMA], ONF [ONF],
   ONOS [ONOS], have proposed intents as a declarative interface for
   defining a set of network operations to execute.

   As such, IETF [ANIMA] defines intent as a declarative policy and
   focuses on providing a more complete definition of it, a tentative
   format, and a life-cycle. Within ONF [ONOS] intent is represented as
   a list of CLI commands that allows users to pass low-level details on
   the network, such as flows, or host addresses. ONF through its
   Boulder and Aspen projects focuses on NBI semantics and intent
   models.

   As it can be observed, each of the aforementioned SDOs came up with
   their own way of specifying an intent, and with their own
   understanding of what an Intent is. Each SDO defines a set of terms
   and level of abstraction, its intended users, and the applications
   and usage scenarios.


   However, all intent approaches proposed by SDOs share the same
   following features:

   o It must be declarative in nature, meaning that a user specifies the
      goal on the network without specifying how to achieve that goal.

   o It must be vendor agnostic, in the sense that it abstracts the
      network capabilities, or the network infrastructure from the user,
      and it can be ported across different platforms.

   o It must provide an easy-to-use interface, which simplifies the
      users' interaction with the intent system through the usage of
      familiar terminology or concepts.

   o It should be able to detect and resolve intent conflicts.

   Currently, work is underway on unifying a common understanding of
   intent concepts and terminology. [CLEMM] is currently leading these
   efforts by defining intent as higher-level declarative policy that
   operates at the level of network and services it provides, and by
   capturing the differences between intent, policy and service.

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification                July 2020


   However, even with proposed intent concepts and terminology, and
   agreement on common intent characteristics, an intent may still be
   viewed in different ways by different stakeholders for different use
   cases and solutions.

   The goal of this document is to clarify what an intent represents for
   different stakeholders, by means of classification on various
   dimensions, such as solutions, users and intent types. This
   classification could ensure a common understanding across all
   participants and it can be used to identify the scope and priorities
   of individual projects, PoCs, research or open-source projects.


   This is achieved by proposing the methodology and initial
   classification tables. This methodology can be used to update the
   tables by adding or removing different solutions, users or intent
   types in order to cater for future scenarios, applications or
   domains.


   Together with [CLEMM], this draft aims to become the foundation for
   future intent-related topic discussions where all participants have
   the same common understanding.

4. Abstract Intent Requirements

   In order to understand the different intent requirements that would
   drive intent classification, we first need to understand what intent
   means for different intent users.

4.1. What is Intent?

   The term Intent has become very widely used in the industry for
   different purposes, sometimes it is not even in agreement with SDO
   shared principles mentioned in the Introduction.

   Different stakeholders consider an intent to be an ECA policy, a GBP
   policy, a business policy, a network service, a customer service, a
   network configuration, application / application group policy, any
   operator/administrator task, network troubleshooting / diagnostics /
   test, a new app, a marketing term for existing
   management/orchestration capabilities, etc. Their intent is sometimes
   technical, non-technical, abstract or technology specific. For some
   stakeholders, intent is a subset of these and for other stakeholders
   intent is all of these. It has in some cases become a term to replace
   a very generic 'service' or 'policy' terminology.

   Concerning this, [CLEMM] draft brings clarification with relation to
   what an intent is and how it differentiates from policies and
   services.

   While it is easier for those familiar with different standards to
   understand what service, CFS, RFS, resource, policy continuum, ECA
   policy, declarative policy, abstract policy or intent policy is, it
   may be more difficult for the wider audience.

   An intent is mistaken by many to be just a synonym for policy. While
   it is easier for those familiar with different standards to
   understand what service, CFS, RFS, resource, policy continuum, ECA
   policy, declarative policy, abstract policy or intent policy is, it
   may be more difficult for the wider audience. Furthermore, those
   familiar with policies understand the difference between a business,
   intent, declarative, imperative, and ECA policy.

   Therefore, it is important to start a discussion in the industry
   about what intent is for different solutions and intent users. It is
   also imperative to try to propose some intent categories /

   classifications that could be understood by a wider audience. This
   would help us define intent interfaces, DSLs and models.

4.2. Intent Solutions and Intent Users

   Different Solutions and Actors have different requirements,
   expectations and priorities for intent-driven networking. They
   require different intent types and have different use cases. Some
   users are more technical and require intents that expose more
   technical information. Other users do not understand networks and
   require intents that shield them from different networking concepts
   and technologies. The following are the solutions and intent users
   that intent-driven networking needs to support:

         +--------------------+------------------------------------+
         | Solutions          | Intent Users                       |
         +--------------------+------------------------------------+
         | Carrier Networks   | Network Operator                   |
         |                    | Service Designers                  |
         |                    | Service Operators                  |
         |                    | Customers/Subscribers              |
         +--------------------+------------------------------------+
         | DC Networks        | Cloud Administrator                |
         |                    | Underlay Network Administrator     |
         |                    | App Developers                     |
         |                    | End-Users                          |
         +--------------------+------------------------------------+
         | Enterprise Networks| Enterprise Administrator           |
         |                    | App Developers                     |
         |                    | End-Users                          |
         +--------------------+------------------------------------+

   These intent solutions and intent users represent a starting point
   for the classification and are expendable through the methodology
   presented in Section 5.1.

   o For carrier networks scenario, for example, if the end-users wants
      to watch high-definition video, then the intent is to convert the
      video image to 1080p rate for the users.

   o For DC networks scenario, administrators have their own clear
      network intent such as load balancing. For all traffic flows that
      need NFV service chaining, restrict the maximum load of any VNF
      node/container below 50% and the maximum load of any network link
      below 70%.

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification                July 2020


   o For Enterprise Networks scenario, enterprise administrators
      express their intent from an external client (application service
      provider). For example, when hosting a video conference, multiple
      remote access is required. The intent expressed to the network
      operator: For any user of this application, the arrival time of
      hologram objects of all the remote tele-presenters should be
      synchronised within 50ms to reach the destination viewer for each
      conversation session.

4.3. Current Problems and Requirements

   Network APIs and CLIs are too complex due to the fact that they
   expose technologies & topologies. App developers and end-users do not
   want to set IP Addresses, VLANs, subnets, ports, etc. Operators and
   administrators would also benefit from the simpler interfaces, like:

   o Allow Customer Site A to be connected to Internet via Network B

   o Allow User A to access all internal resources, except the Server B

   o Allow User B to access Internet via Corporate Network A

   o Move all Users from Corporate Network A to the Corporate Network B

   o Request Gold VPN service between my sites A, B and C

   o Provide CE Redundancy for all Customer Sites

   o Add Access Rules to my Service

   Networks are complex, with many different protocols and
   encapsulations. Some basic questions are not easy to answer:

   o Can User A talk to User B?

   o Can Host A talk to Host B?

   o Are there any loops in my network?

   o Are Network A and Network B connected?

   o Can User A listen to communications between Users B and C?

   Operators and Administrators manually troubleshoot and fix their
   networks and services. They instead want:



Li, et al.            Expires January 28, 2021                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification                July 2020


   o a reliable network that is self-configured and self-assured based
         on the intent

   o to be notified about the problem before the user is aware

   o automation of network / service recovery based on intent (self-
         healing, self-optimization)

   o to get suggestions about correction / optimization steps based on
         experience (historical data and behaviour)

   Therefore, Operators and Administrators want to:

   o simplify and automate network operations

   o simplify definitions of network services

   o provide simple customer APIs for Value Added Services (operators)

   o be informed if the network or service is not behaving as requested

   o enable automatic optimization and correction for selected
      scenarios

   o have systems that learn from historic information and behaviour

   End-users cannot build their own services and policies without
   becoming technical experts and they must perform manual maintenance
   actions. Application developers and end-users/subscribers want to be
   able to:

   o build their own network services with their own policies via
         simple interfaces, without becoming networking experts

   o have their network services up and running based on intent and
         automation only, without any manual actions or maintenance

4.4. Intent Types that need to be supported

   The following intent types need to be supported, in order to address
   the requirements from different solutions and intent users:

   o Customer network service intent

        o for customer self-service

        o for service operator orders

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification                July 2020


        o for intent-driven network configuration, verification,
             correction and optimization

   o Network resource management

        o For network configuration

        o For automated life-cycle management of network configurations

        o For network resources (switches, routers, routing, policies,
             underlay)

   o Cloud and cloud resource management

        o For DC configuration, VMs, DB Servers, APP Servers

        o For communication between VMs

        o For cloud resource life-cycle management (policy driven self-
             configuration and auto-scaling and recovery/optimization)

   o Network Policy intent

        o For security, QoS, application policies, traffic steering, etc

        o For configuring and monitoring policies, alarms generation for
          non-compliance, auto-recovery

   o Task-based intents

        o For network migration

        o For server replacements

        o For device replacements

        o For network software upgrades

        o To automate any tasks that operators/administrator often
           perform

   o System policies intents

        o For intent management system policies

        o For design models and policies for network service design

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification                July 2020


        o For design models and policies for network design

        o For design workflows, models and policies for task-based
             intents

   o Intents that affect other intents

        o It may be task-based intent that modifies many other intents.

        o The task itself is short-lived, but the modification of other
             intents has an impact on their life-cycle, so those changes
             must continue to be continuously monitored and self-
             corrected/self-optimized.

5. Functional Characteristics and Behavior

   Intent can be used to operate immediately on a target (much like
   issuing a command), or whenever it is appropriate (e.g., in response
   to an event). In either case, intent has a number of behaviors that
   serve to further organize its purpose, as described by the following
   subsections.

5.1. Abstracting Intent Operation

   The modelling of Intents can be abstracted using the following
   three-tuple:

   {Context, Capabilities, Constraints}

    o Context grounds the intent, and determines if it is relevant or
      not for the current situation. Thus, context selects intents based
      on applicability.

    o Capabilities describe the functionality that the intent can
      perform.  Capabilities take different forms, depending on the
      expressivity of the intent as well as the programming paradigm(s)
      used.

    o Constraints define any restrictions on the capabilities to be used
      for that particular context.

   Metadata can be attached via strategy templates to each of the
   elements of the three-tuple, and may be used to describe how the
   intent should be used and how it operates, as well as prescribe any
   operational dependencies that must be taken into account.

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification                July 2020


5.2. Intent User Types

   Intent user types, or intent actors as they are known in the area of
   declarative policy, represent the users that define and issue the
   intent request. Depending on the Intent Solutions, there are specific
   intent actors. Examples of intent actors are customers, network
   operators, service operators, enterprise, cloud, and underlay network
   administrators, or application developers.

   o Customers and end-users do not necessarily know the functional and
      operational details of the network that they are using.
      Furthermore, they lack skills to understand such details; in fact,
      such knowledge is typically not relevant to their job. In
      addition, the network may not expose these details to its users.
      This class of actor focuses on the applications that they run, and
      uses services offered by the network.  Hence, they want to specify
      policies that provide consistent behaviour according to their
      business needs. They do not have to worry about how the intents
      are deployed onto the underlying network, and especially, whether
      the intents need to be translated to different forms to enable
      network elements to understand them.

   o Application developers work in a set of abstractions defined by
      their application and programming environment(s). For example,
      many application developers think in terms of objects (e.g., a
      VPN).  While this makes sense to the application developer, most
      network devices do not have a VPN object per se; rather, the VPN
      is formed through a set of configuration statements for that
      device in concert with configuration statements for the other
      devices that together make up the VPN. Hence, the view of
      application developers matches the services provided by the
      network, but may not directly correspond to other views of other
      actors.

   o Management personnel, such as network operators, may have the
      knowledge of the underlying network. However, they may not
      understand the details of the applications and services of
      Customers and End-Users.

5.3. Intent Scope

   Intent are used to manage the behaviour of the networks they are
   applied to and all intents are applied within a specific scope, such
   as:





Li, et al.            Expires January 28, 2021               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification                July 2020


   o Connectivity scope, if the intent creates or modifies a
      connection.
   o Security scope, if the intent specifies the security
      characteristics of the network or users.
   o Application scope, when the intent specifies the applications to
      be affected by the intent request.
   o QoS Scope, when the intent specifies the QoS characteristics of
      the network.

   These intent scopes are expendable through the methodology presented
   in Section 6.1. .


5.4. Intent Network Scope

   Regardless on the intent user type, their intent request is affecting
   the network, or network components, which are representing the intent
   targets.

   Thus, intent network scope, or policy target as known in the area of
   declarative policy, can represent VNFs or PNFs, Physical Network
   Elements, Campus networks, SD-WAN networks, radio access networks,
   cloud edge, cloud core, branch, etc.

5.5. Intent Abstraction

   Intent can be classified by whether it is necessary to feedback
   technical network information or non-technical information to the
   intended proponent after the intent is executed. As well, intent
   abstraction covers the level of technical details in the intent
   itself.

   o For ordinary users, they do not care how the intent is executed,
      or the details of the network. As a result, they do not need to
      know the configuration information of the underlying network. They
      only focus on whether the intent execution result achieves the
      goal, and the execution effect such as the quality of completion
      and the length of execution. In this scenario, we refer to an
      abstraction without technical feedback.

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification                July 2020


   o For administrators, such as network administrators, they perform
      intents, such as allocating network resources, selecting
      transmission paths, handling network failures, etc. They require
      multiple feedback indicators for network resource conditions,
      congestion conditions, fault conditions, etc. after execution. In
      this case, we refer to an abstraction with technical feedback.

5.6. Intent Life-cycle

   Intents can be classified into transient and persistent intents:

   o If intent is transient, it has no life-cycle management.  As soon
      as the specified operation is successfully carried out, the intent
      is finished, and can no longer affect the target object.

   o If the intent is persistent, it has life-cycle management.  Once
      the intent is successfully activated and deployed, the system will
      keep all relevant intents active until they are deactivated or
      removed.

5.7. Hierarchy

   In different phases of the autonomous driving network [TMF-auto], the
   intents are different. A typical example of autonomous driving
   network Level 0 to 5 are listed as below.

   o Level 0 - Traditional manual network: O&M personnel manually
      control the network and obtain network alarms and logs. - No
      intent

   o Level 1 - Partially automated network: Automated scripts are used
      to automate service provisioning, network deployment, and
      maintenance. Shallow perception of network status and decision
      making suggestions of machine; - No intent

   o Level 2 - Automated network: Automation of most service
      provisioning, network deployment, and maintenance comprehensive
      perception of network status and local machine decision making; -
      simple intent on service provisioning

   o Level 3 - Self-optimization network: Deep awareness of network
      status and automatic network control, meeting users' network
      intentions. - Intent based on network status cognition

   o Level 4 - Partial autonomous network: In a limited environment,
      people do not need to participate in decision-making and adjust
      themselves. - Intent based on limited AI

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification                July 2020


   o Level 5 - Autonomous network: In different network environments
      and network conditions, the network can automatically adapt to and
      adjust to meet people's intentions. - Intent based on AI

6. Intent Classification

   This chapter proposes an intent classification approach that may help
   to classify mainstream intent related demos / tools.

   The three classifications in this draft have been proposed from
   scratch, following the methodology presented, through three
   iterations: one for carrier Intent Solution, one for DC Intent
   Solution, and one for enterprise Intent Solution. For each Intent
   solution, we identified the specific Intent Users and Intent Types.
   Then, we further identified the Intent Scope, Network Scope,
   Abstractions, and Life-cycle requirements.

   These classifications and the generated tables can be easily
   extended. For example, for the DC Intent Solution, a new category is
   identified, i.e.  Resource Scope, and the classification table has
   been extended accordingly.

   In the future, as new scenarios, applications, and domains are
   emerging, new classifications and taxonomies can be identified,
   following the proposed methodology.

   The output of the intent classification is the intent taxonomy
   introduced in the next sections.

   Thus, this section first introduces the proposed intent
   classification methodology, followed by consolidated intent taxonomy
   for three intent solutions, and then by concrete examples of intent
   classifications for three different intent solutions (e.g. Carrier
   Network, Data Center, and Enterprise) that were derived using the
   proposed methodology and then can be filled in for PoCs, demos,
   research projects or future drafts.

6.1. Intent Classification Methodology

   This section describes the methodology used to derive the initial
   classification proposed in the draft. The proposed methodology can be
   used to create new intent classifications from scratch, by analysing
   the solution knowledge. As well, the methodology can be used to
   update existing classification tables by adding or removing different
   solutions, users or intent types in order to cater for future
   scenarios, applications or domains.

   We first classify intents into intent types and describe each type
   based on the solution it belongs to and what intent user it is for.
   We than present different categories that these intent type can
   belong to, based on intent scope, network scope, intent abstraction
   and life-cycle.

7. Involvement of Intent in the Application of AI to Network Manage ment

   In the application of AI to NM, an intent is expected to be, on the
   one hand, a formal definition of a goal or policy instructed to the
   decision system and, on the other hand, a formal definition of the
   specific actions that some network controller must perform. Goal
   intents and policy intents have different meanings. The former will
   establish an objective for the automated management system to
   accomplish, such as "avoiding latency to be higher than 10 ms".
   Meanwhile, policy intents set the overall regulations and possible
   actions that the AI system can use to achieve those goals. Both goal
   and policy intents are expected to be provided by humans, although
   they must be in some very formal language that can be easily
   understood by computers. All those relations make the degree of
   formality an important dimension to classify intents so that users,
   which here are AI-based agents, can be able to choose the proper
   solution to consume them.

   AI technology has played an important role in the different stages of
   the intent network implementation.

   o Help identify and prevent security threats: Classification
      algorithms can attempt to identify malware or other undesirable
      web content or usage;

   o Intentional translation: use AI algorithm to assist the
      translation module, split translation into the requirements
      contained in the semantics of the intention; automatic delivery
      and execution strategy; Automate tasks and appropriate network
      changes based on the existing network infrastructure configuration
      according to the policy model;

   o Adaptive adjustment: perceive the quality of the user experience
      and perform predictive analysis to proactively optimize
      performance, such as excessive access time;



   To enforce the resulting actions determined by AI-based control
   modules, action intents will have a format that avoids misconceptions
   as much as possible. This means that they will be closer to machine
   language structures than natural (human) language structures. This
   can sacrificing some degree of human understandability, so it forms
   another dimension in the classification of intents. This dimension
   allows automated systems to discern which format of intent to use in
   relation to the possibility and degree of humans to be involved in
   their exchanges.

   Finally, as intents can use different words and languages to refer to
   the same concepts, all intents related to AI will be required to
   follow a specific ontology. This way, input intents will be easily
   semantically translated to formal structures. Output intents will
   also be composed by following the ontology, so receivers of those
   intents will be able to easily understand them.

   For instance, in the intent classification, the machine learning
   algorithm can be utilized to extract the intent feature values and
   classify the intent according to the intent feature distribution. For
   example, using artificial intelligence clustering algorithm, a large
   number of intents proposed by different users are used as training
   data to extract multiple feature dimensions, such as vocabulary
   information intended to be used, related feature parameters, context
   proposed by the intent, and the like. Cluster analysis is performed
   in the same form as the coordinate system, and multiple categories
   are classified according to the characteristics of the sample point
   distribution. For the input intent later, the category of the intent
   is judged based on the similarity with all categories.

   o For specific classification intents, such as safety or fault
      information, conditions can be preset in advance, and once a
      common error message occurs, it will automatically alarm.

   o For the network resource information, set the corresponding
      threshold information. When there is a certain number of link
      users or the network traffic is too large, the adjustment
      intention is started.

   o For users with higher priority, the resources can be configured
      preferentially.
