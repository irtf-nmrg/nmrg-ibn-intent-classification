Abstract

   RFC7575 defines Intent as an abstract high-level policy used to
   operate the network. Intent management system includes an interface
   for users to input requests and an engine to translate the intents
   into the network configuration and manage their life-cycle. Up to
   now, there is no commonly agreed definition, interface or model of
   intent.

   This document discusses mostly the concept of network intents, but
   other types of intents are also being considered. Specifically, it
   highlights stakeholder perspectives of intent, methods to classify
   and encode intent, the associated intent taxonomy, and defines
   relevant intent terms where necessary. This document provides a
   foundation for intent related research and facilitate solution
   development.

1. Introduction

   The vision of intent-driven networks has attracted a lot of
   attention, as it promises to simplify the management of networks by
   human operators. This is done by simply specifying what should happen
   on the network, without giving any instructions on how to do it. This


Li, et al.               Expires May 2, 2021                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2020


   promise led many telecom companies to begin adopting this new vision,
   and many Standards Development Organization (SDOs) to propose
   different intent framework.

   Several SDOs and open source projects, such as Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF) (by the Autonomic Networking Integrated Model and
   Approach Working Group [ANIMA]), Open Networking Foundation (ONF)
   [ONF], Open Network Operating System (ONOS) [ONOS], have proposed
   intents for defining a set of network operations to execute in a
   declarative manner.

   IETF [ANIMA] defines intent as a declarative policy, but still lacks
   a more complete definition, a tentative format, and a life-cycle.
   Within ONOS [ONOS], intent is represented as a list of Command-Line
   Interface (CLI) commands that allows users to bypass low-level
   details on the network, such as flows or host addresses. ONF through
   its Boulder and Aspen projects focuses on Northbound Interface (NBI)
   semantics and intent models.

   The SDOs usually came up with their own way of specifying an intent,
   and with their own understanding of what an intent is. Besides that,
   each SDO defines a set of terms and level of abstraction, its
   intended users, and the applications and usage scenarios.

   However, most intent approaches proposed by SDOs share the same
   following features:

   o It must be declarative in nature, meaning that a user specifies the
      goal on the network without specifying how to achieve that goal.

   o It must be vendor agnostic, in the sense that it abstracts the
      network capabilities, or the network infrastructure from the user,
      and it can be ported across different platforms.

   o It must provide an easy-to-use interface, which simplifies the
      users' interaction with the intent system through the usage of
      familiar terminology or concepts.

   o It should be able to detect and resolve intent conflicts, which
      include, for example, static (compile-time) conflicts and dynamic
      (run-time) conflicts.

   Currently, work is underway on unifying a common understanding of
   intent concepts and terminology. Concerning NMRG, [CLEMM] is a
   document to present a definition for intent as higher-level
   declarative policy that operates at the level of network and services

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2020


   it provides. In addition, this document captures the differences
   between intent, policy and service.

   However, even with proposed intent concepts and terminology, as well
   as agreement on common intent characteristics, an intent may still be
   viewed in different ways by different stakeholders for different use
   cases and solutions. This document mostly addresses intents in the
   context of network intents, however other types of intents are not
   excluded, as presented in Section 4.4. and Section 6.2. .

   The goal of this document is to clarify what an intent represents for
   different stakeholders through a classification on various
   dimensions, such as solutions, users, and intent types. This
   classification can ensure a common understanding across all
   participants and be used to identify the scope and priorities of
   individual projects, Proof of Concepts (PoCs), research initiatives,
   or open-source projects. This goal is achieved by proposing the
   methodology and initial classification tables. This methodology can
   be used to update the tables by adding or removing different
   solutions, users or intent types in order to cater for future
   scenarios, applications or domains.

   The present document, together with [CLEMM], aims to become the
   foundation for future intent-related topic discussions regarding the
   NMRG.

4. Abstract Intent Requirements

   In order to understand the different intent requirements that would
   drive intent classification, we first need to understand what intent
   means for different intent users.

4.1. What is Intent?

   The term Intent has become very widely used in the industry for
   different purposes, sometimes it is not even in agreement with SDO
   shared principles mentioned in the Introduction.

   Different stakeholders consider an intent to be an ECA policy, a GBP
   policy, a business policy, a network service, a customer service, a
   network configuration, application/application group policy, any
   operator/administrator task, network troubleshooting/diagnostics/
   test, a new app, a marketing term for existing
   management/orchestration capabilities, etc. Their intent is sometimes
   technical, non-technical, abstract or technology specific. For some
   stakeholders, intent is a subset of these and for other stakeholders
   intent is all of these. It has in some cases become a term to replace
   a very generic 'service' or 'policy' terminology.

   Concerning this, [CLEMM] draft brings clarification with relation to
   what an intent is and how it differentiates from policies and
   services. Future versions of this draft will be kept aligned with
   [CLEMM].

   While it is easier for those familiar with different standards to
   understand what service, CFS, RFS, resource, policy continuum, ECA
   policy, declarative policy, abstract policy or intent policy is, it
   may be more difficult for the wider audience.

   An intent is mistaken by many to be just a synonym for policy. While
   it is easier for those familiar with different standards to
   understand what service, CFS, RFS, resource, policy continuum, ECA
   policy, declarative policy, abstract policy or intent policy is, it
   may be more difficult for the wider audience. Furthermore, those
   familiar with policies understand the difference between a business,
   intent, declarative, imperative, and ECA policy.

   Therefore, it is important to start a discussion in the industry
   about what intent is for different solutions and intent users. It is
   also imperative to try to propose some intent categories/

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2020


   classifications that could be understood by a wider audience. This
   would help us define intent interfaces, DSLs and models.

4.2. Intent Solutions and Intent Users

   Different Solutions and Actors have different requirements,
   expectations and priorities for intent-driven networking. They
   require different intent types and have different use cases. Some
   users are more technical and require intents that expose more
   technical information. Other users do not understand networks and
   require intents that shield them from different networking concepts
   and technologies. The following are the solutions and intent users
   that intent-driven networking needs to support:

         +--------------------+------------------------------------+
         | Solutions          | Intent Users                       |
         +--------------------+------------------------------------+
         | Carrier Networks   | Network Operator                   |
         |                    | Service Designers                  |
         |                    | Service Operators                  |
         |                    | Customers/Subscribers              |
         +--------------------+------------------------------------+
         | DC Networks        | Cloud Administrator                |
         |                    | Underlay Network Administrator     |
         |                    | App Developers                     |
         |                    | End-Users                          |
         +--------------------+------------------------------------+
         | Enterprise Networks| Enterprise Administrator           |
         |                    | App Developers                     |
         |                    | End-Users                          |
         +--------------------+------------------------------------+

   These intent solutions and intent users represent a starting point
   for the classification and are expendable through the methodology
   presented in Section 6.1. .

   o For carrier networks scenario, for example, if the end-users wants
      to watch high-definition video, then the intent is to convert the
      video image to 1080p rate for the users.

   o For DC networks scenario, administrators have their own clear
      network intent such as load balancing. For all traffic flows that
      need NFV service chaining, restrict the maximum load of any VNF
      node/container below 50% and the maximum load of any network link
      below 70%.

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2020


   o For Enterprise Networks scenario, enterprise administrators
      express their intent from an external client (application service
      provider). For example, when hosting a video conference, multiple
      remote accesses are required. An example of the intent expressed
      to the network operator is: For any user of this application, the
      arrival time of hologram objects of all the remote tele-presenters
      should be synchronised within 50ms to reach the destination viewer
      for each conversation session.

4.3. Current Problems and Requirements

   Network APIs and CLIs are too complex due to the fact that they
   expose technologies and topologies. App developers and end-users do
   not want to set IP Addresses, VLANs, subnets, ports, etc. Operators
   and administrators would also benefit from the simpler interfaces,
   like:

o Allow Customer Site A to be connected to Internet via Network B

o Allow User A to access all internal resources, except the Server B

o Allow User B to access Internet via Corporate Network A

o Move all Users from Corporate Network A to the Corporate Network B

o Request Gold VPN service between my sites A, B and C

o Provide CE Redundancy for all Customer Sites

o Add Access Rules to my Service

   Networks are complex, with many different protocols and
   encapsulations. Some basic questions are not easy to answer:

o Can User A talk to User B?

o Can Host A talk to Host B?

o Are there any loops in my network?

o Are Network A and Network B connected?

o Can User A listen to communications between Users B and C?

   Operators and Administrators manually troubleshoot and fix their
   networks and services. They instead want:

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2020


o a reliable network that is self-configured and self-assured based on
      the intent

o to be notified about the problem before the user is aware

o automation of network/service recovery based on intent (self-healing,
      self-optimization)

o to get suggestions about correction/optimization steps based on
      experience (historical data and behaviour)

   Therefore, Operators and Administrators want to:

o simplify and automate network operations

o simplify definitions of network services

o provide simple customer APIs for Value Added Services (operators)

o be informed if the network or service is not behaving as requested

o enable automatic optimization and correction for selected scenarios

o have systems that learn from historic information and behaviour

   End-users cannot build their own services and policies without
   becoming technical experts and they must perform manual maintenance
   actions. Application developers and end-users/subscribers want to be
   able to:

o build their own network services with their own policies via simple
      interfaces, without becoming networking experts

o have their network services up and running based on intent and
      automation only, without any manual actions or maintenance

4.4. Intent Types that need to be supported

   The following intent types need to be supported, in order to address
   the requirements from different solutions and intent users:

o Customer service intent

     o   for customer self-service with SLA or add a service

     o   for service operator orders



Li, et al.               Expires May 2, 2021                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2020


o Network and Underlay Network service intent

     o   for service operator orders

     o   for intent driven network configuration, verification,
          correction and optimization

     o   for intent created and provided by the underlay network
          administrator

o Network and Underlay Network intent

     o   For network configuration

     o   For automated lifecycle management of network configurations

     o   For network resources (switches, routers, routing, policies,
          underlay)

o Cloud management intent

     o   For DC configuration, VMs, DB Servers, APP Servers

     o   For communication between VMs

o Cloud resource management intent

     o   For cloud resource life-cycle management (policy driven self-
          configuration and auto-scaling and recovery/optimization)

o Strategy intent

     o   For security, QoS, application policies, traffic steering, etc.

     o   For configuring and monitoring policies, alarms generation for
          non-compliance, auto-recovery

     o   For design models and policies for network and network service
          design

     o   For design workflows, models and policies for operational task
          intents

o Operational task intents

     o   For network migration

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2020


     o   For server replacements

     o   For device replacements

     o   For network software upgrades

     o   To automate any tasks that operators/administrator often
           perform

o Intents that affect other intents

     o   It may be task-based intent that modifies many other intents.

     o   The task itself is short-lived, but the modification of other
          intents has an impact on their life-cycle, so those changes
          must continue to be continuously monitored and self-
          corrected/self-optimized.

5. Functional Characteristics and Behaviour

   Intent can be used to operate immediately on a target (much like
   issuing a command), or whenever it is appropriate (e.g., in response
   to an event). In either case, intent has a number of behaviours that
   serve to further organize its purpose, as described by the following
   subsections.

5.1. Abstracting Intent Operation

   The modelling of Intents can be abstracted using the following
   three-tuple:

   {Context, Capabilities, Constraints}

    o Context grounds the intent, and determines if it is relevant or
      not for the current situation. Thus, context selects intents based
      on applicability.

    o Capabilities describe the functionality that the intent can
      perform.  Capabilities take different forms, depending on the
      expressivity of the intent as well as the programming paradigm(s)
      used.

    o Constraints define any restrictions on the capabilities to be used
      for that particular context.

   Metadata can be attached via strategy templates to each of the
   elements of the three-tuple, and may be used to describe how the

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2020


   intent should be used and how it operates, as well as prescribe any
   operational dependencies that must be taken into account.

5.2. Intent User Types

   Intent user types, or intent actors as they are known in the area of
   declarative policy, represent the users that define and issue the
   intent request. Depending on the Intent Solutions, there are specific
   intent actors. Examples of intent actors are customers, network
   operators, service operators, enterprise administrators, cloud
   administrators, and underlay network administrators, or application
   developers.

   o Customers and end-users do not necessarily know the functional and
      operational details of the network that they are using.
      Furthermore, they lack skills to understand such details; in fact,
      such knowledge is typically not relevant to their job. In
      addition, the network may not expose these details to its users.
      This class of actor focuses on the applications that they run, and
      uses services offered by the network.  Hence, they want to specify
      policies that provide consistent behaviour according to their
      business needs. They do not have to worry about how the intents
      are deployed onto the underlying network, and especially, whether
      the intents need to be translated to different forms to enable
      network elements to understand them.

   o Application developers work in a set of abstractions defined by
      their application and programming environment(s). For example,
      many application developers think in terms of objects (e.g., a
      VPN).  While this makes sense to the application developer, most
      network devices do not have a VPN object per se; rather, the VPN
      is formed through a set of configuration statements for that
      device in concert with configuration statements for the other
      devices that together make up the VPN. Hence, the view of
      application developers matches the services provided by the
      network, but may not directly correspond to other views of other
      actors.

   o Management personnel, such as network operators, may have the
      knowledge of the underlying network. However, they may not
      understand the details of the applications and services of
      Customers and End-Users.

5.3. Intent Scope

   Intent are used to manage the behaviour of the networks they are
   applied to and all intents are applied within a specific scope, such
   as:

   o Connectivity scope, if the intent creates or modifies a
      connection.
   o Security scope, if the intent specifies the security
      characteristics of the network or users.
   o Application scope, when the intent specifies the applications to
      be affected by the intent request.
   o QoS Scope, when the intent specifies the QoS characteristics of
      the network.

   These intent scopes are expendable through the methodology presented
   in Section 6.1. .


5.4. Intent Network Scope

   Regardless on the intent user type, their intent request is affecting
   the network, or network components, which are representing the intent
   targets.

   Thus, intent network scope, or policy target as known in the area of
   declarative policy, can represent VNFs or PNFs, Physical Network
   Elements, Campus networks, SD-WAN networks, radio access networks,
   cloud edge, cloud core, branch, etc.

5.5. Intent Abstraction

   Intent can be classified by whether it is necessary to feedback
   technical network information or non-technical information to the
   intended proponent after the intent is executed. As well, intent
   abstraction covers the level of technical details in the intent
   itself.

   o For ordinary users, they do not care how the intent is executed,
      or the details of the network. As a result, they do not need to
      know the configuration information of the underlying network. They
      only focus on whether the intent execution result achieves the
      goal, and the execution effect such as the quality of completion
      and the length of execution. In this scenario, we refer to an
      abstraction without technical feedback.

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2020


   o For administrators, such as network administrators, they perform
      intents, such as allocating network resources, selecting
      transmission paths, handling network failures, etc. They require
      multiple feedback indicators for network resource conditions,
      congestion conditions, fault conditions, etc. after execution. In
      this case, we refer to an abstraction with technical feedback.

   As per intent definition provided in [CLEMM], lower-level intents are
   not considered to qualify as intents. However, we kept this
   classification to identify any PoCs/Demos/Use Cases that still either
   require or implement lower level of abstraction for intents.



5.6. Intent Life-cycle

   Intents can be classified into transient and persistent intents:

   o If intent is transient, it has no life-cycle management.  As soon
      as the specified operation is successfully carried out, the intent
      is finished, and can no longer affect the target object.

   o If the intent is persistent, it has life-cycle management.  Once
      the intent is successfully activated and deployed, the system will
      keep all relevant intents active until they are deactivated or
      removed.

5.7. Hierarchy

   In different phases of the autonomous driving network [TMF-auto], the
   intents are different. A typical example of autonomous driving
   network Level 0 to 5 are listed as below.

   o Level 0 - Traditional manual network: O&M personnel manually
      control the network and obtain network alarms and logs. - No
      intent

   o Level 1 - Partially automated network: Automated scripts are used
      to automate service provisioning, network deployment, and
      maintenance. Shallow perception of network status and decision
      making suggestions of machine; - No intent

   o Level 2 - Automated network: Automation of most service
      provisioning, network deployment, and maintenance comprehensive
      perception of network status and local machine decision making; -
      simple intent on service provisioning

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2020


   o Level 3 - Self-optimization network: Deep awareness of network
      status and automatic network control, meeting users' network
      intentions. - Intent based on network status cognition

   o Level 4 - Partial autonomous network: In a limited environment,
      people do not need to participate in decision-making and adjust
      themselves. - Intent based on limited AI

   o Level 5 - Autonomous network: In different network environments
      and network conditions, the network can automatically adapt to and
      adjust to meet people's intentions. - Intent based on AI

6. Intent Classification

   This chapter proposes an intent classification approach that may help
   to classify mainstream intent related demos/tools.

   The three classifications in this draft have been proposed from
   scratch, following the methodology presented, through three
   iterations: one for carrier Intent Solution, one for DC Intent
   Solution, and one for enterprise Intent Solution. For each Intent
   solution, we identified the specific Intent Users and Intent Types.
   Then, we further identified the Intent Scope, Network Scope,
   Abstractions, and Life-cycle requirements.

   These classifications and the generated tables can be easily
   extended. For example, for the DC Intent Solution, a new category is
   identified, i.e. Resource Scope, and the classification table has
   been extended accordingly.

   In the future, as new scenarios, applications, and domains are
   emerging, new classifications and taxonomies can be identified,
   following the proposed methodology.

   The output of the intent classification is the intent taxonomy
   introduced in the next sections.

   Thus, this section first introduces the proposed intent
   classification methodology, followed by consolidated intent taxonomy
   for three intent solutions, and then by concrete examples of intent
   classifications for three different intent solutions (e.g. Carrier
   Network, Data Center, and Enterprise) that were derived using the
   proposed methodology and then can be filled in for PoCs, demos,
   research projects or future drafts.

6.1. Intent Classification Methodology

   This section describes the methodology used to derive the initial
   classification proposed in the draft. The proposed methodology can be
   used to create new intent classifications from scratch, by analysing
   the solution knowledge. As well, the methodology can be used to
   update existing classification tables by adding or removing different
   solutions, users or intent types in order to cater for future
   scenarios, applications or domains.

   The intent classification workflow starts from the Solution
   Knowledge, which can provide information on requirements, use cases,
   technologies used, network properties, actors that define and issue
   the intent request, and requirements. The following, defines the
   steps to classify an intent:

   1. The information provided in the solution knowledge is provided as
   input to identifying the intent solution (e.g. Carrier, Enterprise,
   and Data Center). This intent solution is reviewed against the
   existing classification and it can either be used or add/remove the
   intent solution identified from the solution knowledge (R1-U1).

   2. The next step is identifying the intent user types (e.g. customer,
   network operators, service operators, etc.) and then review existing
   classification and use it or add/remove the intent user type
   identified from the solution knowledge (R2-U2).

   3. The next phase is to identify the type of intent (e.g. Network
   Intent, Customer Service Intent) and then review existing
   classification and use/add/remove the intent type (R3-U3).

   4. The forth step is identifying the intent scope (e.g. Connectivity,
   Application) based on the Solution Knowledge and then review existing
   classification and use/add/remove the identified intent scope (R4-
   U4).

   5. The next step is to identify the network scope (e.g. Campus, Radio
   Access) and then then review existing classification and either use
   it or add/remove the identified network scope (R5-U5).

   6. The next phase is to identify the abstractions (e.g. technical,
   non-technical) and then review existing classification and
   use/add/remove the abstractions (R6-U6).

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2020


   7. The seventh step is to identify the life-cycle requirements (e.g.
   persistent, transient) and then review existing classification and
   use/add/remove the life-cycle requirements (R7-U7).

   8. The last step is to identify any new categories and use/add the
   newly identified categories. New categories can be identified as new
   domains or applications are emerging, or new areas of concern (e.g.
   privacy, compliance) might arise, which are not listed in the
   current methodology.

   6.3.2. Intent Categories

   The following are the proposed categories:
       Intent Scope: C1=Connectivity, C2=Security, C3=Application,
        C4=QoS
       Network Scope:
           o                 Network Domain: C1=Radio Access, C2=Transport Access,
             C3=Transport Aggregation, C4=Transport Core, C5=Cloud Edge,
             C6=Cloud Core)
           o                 Network Function (NF) Scope: C1=VNFs, C2=PNFs
       Abstraction(ABS): C1=Technical(with technical feedback), C2=Non-
        technical (without technical feedback) see Section 5.2. .
       Life-cycle (L-C): C1=Persistent (Full life-cycle), C2=Transient
        (Short Lived)


   6.3.3. Intent Classification Example

   This section depicts an example on how the methodology described in
   Section 6.1. can be used in order to classify intents introduced in
   the 'A Multi-Level Approach to IBN' PoC demonstration [POC-IBN]. The
   PoC considered two intents: slice intents and service chain intents.

   In this PoC [POC-IBN], a slice intent expresses a request for a
   network slice with two types of components: a set of top layer
   virtual functions, and a set of virtual switches and/or routers of
   L2/L3 VNFs. A service chain intent expressed a request for a service
   operated through a chain of service components running in L4-L7
   virtual functions.

   Following the intent classification methodology described step-by-
   step in Section 6.1. , we identify the following:

   1.           The Intent Solution is for the Carrier.

   2.           The Intent User Type is the Network Operator for the slice intent,
      and the Service Operator for the service chain intent

   3.           The Type of Intent, is a Network Service Intent for the slice
      intent, and a Customer Service Intent for the service chain intent.

   4.           The Intent Scopes are connectivity and application.

   5.           The Network Scope is a logical one.

   6.           The Abstractions are with technical feedback for the slice intent,
      and without technical feedback for the service chain intent

   7.           The life-cycle is persistent.



   The following table shows how to represent this information in a
   tabular form. The 'X' in the table refers to the slice intent, and
   the 'Y' in the table refers to the service chain intent.

   6.4.2. Intent Categories

   The following are the proposed categories:
       Intent Scope: C1=Connectivity, C2=Security, C3=Application,
        C4=QoS C5=Storage C6=Compute
       Network Scope
           o                 Network Domain: DC Network
           o                 DCN Network (DCN Net) Scope: C1=Logical, C2=Physical
           o                 DCN Resource (DCN Res) Scope: C1=Virtual, C2=Physical
       Abstraction(ABS): C1=Technical(with technical feedback), C2=Non-
        technical (without technical feedback), see Section 5.2.
       Life-cycle (L-C): C1=Persistent (Full life-cycle), C2=Transient
        (Short Lived)


   6.4.3. Intent Classification Example

   This section depicts an example on how the methodology described in
   Section 6.1. can be used in order to classify intents introduced in
   the 'A Multi-Level Approach to IBN' PoC demonstration [WALTER]. The
   PoC considered two intents: slice intents and service chain intents.

   In this PoC [WALTER], a slice intent expresses a request for a
   network slice with two types of components: a set of top layer
   virtual functions, and a set of virtual switches and/or routers of
   L2/L3 VNFs. A service chain intent expressed a request for a service
   operated through a chain of service components running in L4-L7
   virtual functions.

   Following the intent classification methodology described step-by-
   step in Section 6.1. , we identify the following:

   1.           The Intent Solution is for the Data Center.

   2.           The Intent User Type is the Cloud Administrator for the slice
      intent and service chain intent.

   3.           The Type of Intent, is a Cloud Management intent, for the slice and
      service chain intent.

   4.           The Intent Scopes are connectivity and application.

   5.           The Network Scope is a logical, and the resource scope is virtual.

   6.           The Abstractions are with technical feedback for the slice intent,
      and without technical feedback for the service chain intent

   7.           The life-cycle is persistent.



   The following table shows how to represent this information in a
   tabular form, where the 'X' in the table refers to the slice and
   service chain intent.

6.5. Intent Classification for Enterprise Solution

   6.5.1. Intent Users and Intent Types

   The following table describes the Intent Users in Enterprise
   Solutions and their Intent Types.

   +--------------+-------------+-------------------------------------+
   | Intent User  | Intent Type |    Intent Type Description          |
   +--------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | End-User     | Customer    | Enterprise End-User Self-Service or |
   |              | Service     | Applications, Enterprise may have   |
   |              | Intent      | multiple types of End-Users.        |
   |              |             | Example: Request access to VPN      |
   |              |             | service.                            |
